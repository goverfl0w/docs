# PHP Library

This is our official PHP Library for top.gg, if you have any issues/bugs please submit an issue on our github.

- [GitHub Link](https://github.com/vapourlabs/TopPHP)

(I cannot make a repo for the actual /top-gg/php-sdk version, so a clone will be req.)

## Usage

For our full/comprehensive list of usage, please refer to the github docs.

### Posting bot stats

Posting your bot's statistics is very simple and easily able to be done through the code shown here.

```php
$bot = new Discord(["token" => "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"]); # DiscordPHP/Restcord Client
$DBL = new TopGG("YOUR_API_TOKEN");

// You could also pass a check with $DBL->POST->stats(...)->RESP instead.
$DBL->POST->stats($bot->id, count($bot->guilds));
if($DBL->RESP == 200) echo "Stats were successfully updated.";
```
